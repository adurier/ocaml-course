# ocaml-course

This is the repository for my Functional Programming course in OCaml, that I give since 2023 at [Polytech Paris-Saclay](https://www.polytech-reseau.org/polytech-paris-saclay/) in ‘ET4’ (computer science specialization). I will try to create a full course online, but this is very much work in progress and not at all complete for now.

As is customary in academia, this course is free to be used by any student over the world, as well as any teacher (in academia or other) to use parts of it (exercices, slides) in his course, if only because it itself is based on works of the previous teachers of this course at my university, as well as numerous online courses, and even the courses where I did myself learn on the subject (at Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon). 

Of course, if large parts of this course were to be used ‘as is’ by another teacher, the least would be to reference this course. Because it seems to be the norm on GitHub, and it seems that if you don’t, it can be a source of endless troubles, I did decide to licence this work under CC BY-NC-SA (Creative Commons non-commercial licence for documentation). The only thing I actually ask is that if you intend to reuse this course for commercial purposes or in a commercial, non-academic context, you ask my permission first (which I would very likely give).
