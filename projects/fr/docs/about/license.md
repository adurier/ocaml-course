## Can I use this course ?

As is customary in academia, this course is free to be used by any student over the world, as well as any teacher (in academia or other) to use parts of it (exercices, slides, etc) in his course, if only because it itself is based on works of the previous teachers of this course at my university, as well as numerous online courses, and even the courses where I did myself learn on the subject (at Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon). 

Of course, if large parts of this course were to be used ‘as is’ by another teacher, the least would be to reference this course. 

## Why a license ?

Because it seems to be the norm on GitHub, and it seems that if you don’t licence some online work, it can be a source of endless troubles, I did decide to licence this work under CC BY-NC-SA (Creative Commons non-commercial licence for documentation). The only thing I actually ask is that if you intend to reuse this course for commercial purposes or in a commercial, non-academic context, you ask my permission first (which I would very likely give).

## Why Copyleft ?

Because of my attachment to open-source values, and the free flow of information online; because Wikipedia does it right; because it is the norm in public academia and I am a civil servant, paid with the taxes of the people who actually have a hard job -- and often an essential job at that.
